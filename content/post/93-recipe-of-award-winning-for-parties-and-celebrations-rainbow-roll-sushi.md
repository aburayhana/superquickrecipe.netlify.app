recipeinstructions:
- "Make a basic California roll. I used tuna with mayonnaise instead of imitation crab with mayonnaise."
- "Basic California Rolls -. Attention: This recipe is for making 8 rolls."
- "Once you&#39;ve made the California rolls, let them rest (over 10 minutes)."
- "Prepare the ingredients that will wrap the California roll. Slice the ingredients as thin and long as you can. It will be easier to roll and also look prettier. Getting a block of sashimi and cutting it yourself is easier."
- "Slice the avocado very thinly. To avoid browning, and to add flavor, sprinkle with lemon juice."
- "Place some plastic wrap onto a sushi mat. Arrange the ingredients diagonally on the wrap, starting with avocado → tuna → avocado → salmon in that order."
- "As seen in the left picture, I used 3 pieces of tuna and 2 pieces of salmon this time."
- "Carefully remove the plastic wrap from the California roll. Place the California roll at the center of the outer ingredients."
- "Roll the two together. Imagine lifting the side closer to you upwards as you roll it away from you."
- "Be careful not to wrap the plastic wrap into the roll. Press and shape the roll over the sushi mat."
- "Remove the sushi mat. Leave the plastic wrap on and let the roll settle for a while."
- "The reason why you arrange the ingredients diagonally in Step 6 is because if you cut the roll you&#39;d get more ingredients in every piece. Plus it&#39;ll look more pretty and fun."
- "Cut the roll over the plastic wrap. Hold the roll with your left hand (if you are right-handed). Make the first cut firmly and diagonally into the roll."
- "If you hesitate here, the cutting edge will get squashed. Once you&#39;ve made a slit, concentrate on pushing the knife forward to make a clean cut."
- "Since it&#39;s a Rainbow roll, arrange the pieces in a rainbow-shaped arch. Top with flying fish roe and mayonnaise if you&#39;d like."
- "It&#39;s also good if you arrange them diagonally so all the ingredients show."
