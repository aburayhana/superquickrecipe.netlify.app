recipeingredient:
- "12 each fresh jalapeno peppers"
- "12 slice bacon"
- "1 packages lil smokeys any flavor need 24"
- "1 packages cream cheese"
- "1 tsp cayenne pepper"
- "2 tsp paprika"
- "24 each tooth picks"
recipeinstructions:
- "Preheat oven to 350.  The original recipe called for a smoker at 250°F."
- "Mix room temperature cream cheese with the paprika and cayenne pepper.  Set it aside."
- "Next prepare the jalapeno peppers.  If you have sensitive skin, food preparation gloves may be a strong requirement here.  Cut them in half long wise.  They will look like little boats.  Next take out the seeds.   That&#39;s what the gloves are for."
- "Cut the 12 strips of Bacon in half.  Some cut it long ways but I just cut them in half short ways.  I&#39;ve never had any problems.  Do what is easiest for you."
- "Now assemble by taking one half of a jalepeno, fill it with cream cheese mixture, top with a lil smokey, and wrap all of it with one piece of Bacon.  You will need toothpicks to hold it in place."
- "I place mine on a baking sheet with a rack.  This helps crisp the bottoms of the poppers."
- "Bake for 35 to 40 minutes, depending on how crispy you like your Bacon.  The original recipe called for an hour on the smoker.  No matter which is used, make sure they aren&#39;t over done because you will lose the filling and the jalapeno could get too soft."
- "*NOTE: The Facebook recipe served this with a sweet barbeque sauce.  I have not included it because I didn&#39;t use it.  I imagine any sauce will do.  Enjoy!"
