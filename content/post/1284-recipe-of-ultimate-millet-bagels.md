- "1 tbsp Glutenous Millet"
- "1 tsp Dry yeast"
- "3 tbsp Honey"
- "1/2 tsp Salt"
- "170 ml Lukewarm water"

recipeinstructions:
- "Combine the flour, millet, yeast, honey, and salt. Make sure you put the salt and yeast in separate areas of the bowl. Pour warm water over the dry ingredients, centering the water over the yeast. Mix the dough until it can be shaped into a single ball, and knead for 10-15 minutes."
- "When the kneading is complete, divide the dough into 6 balls. Form these balls by stretching the sides of the dough down to the bottom and up into the center of the dough until the surface is even and smooth. Cover the dough with plastic wrap, or a very lightly dampened tea towel, and rest the dough for about 15 minutes."

- "Repeat the folding a second time, and thoroughly seal the seams together."
- "Strech one end of the dough so it is very thin, and flatten the other end with a rolling pin. Form the dough into a ring shape by wrapping the flattened end of the dough around the thin end. Seal the seams. Preheat the oven to 200℃."
- "Bring some water to a boil in a shallow pan. Add 1 tablespoon of honey or molasses. Add in the bagels and boil on each side for 30 seconds. Place the bagels on a dry tea towel to dry off any excess moisture."
- "Line a baking sheet with parchment paper, and bake the bagels at 200℃ for about 20 minutes."
- "The bagels are done."
- "You can eat the bagels as they are, or cut them in half and smear with your favorite fillings."
