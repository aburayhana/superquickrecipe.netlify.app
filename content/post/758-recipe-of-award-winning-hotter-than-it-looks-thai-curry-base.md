recipeingredient:
- "1/4 yellow onion finely minced"
- "1/4 cup very finely chopped cilantro andor basil This is a great use for all those stems"
- "2 Tablespoons finely minced ginger"
- "2 Tablespoons finely minced garlic"
- "3 serrano chilies finely minced Thai bird chilies are ideal and Chiles de arbol would also work well here"
- "1 Tablespoon crushed red chili flakes like the kind you use on pizza and pasta"
- " the zest of 1 lime or 3 kaffir lime leaves finely julienned"
- "2 Tablespoons oil"
- "1-2 teaspoons curry powder depending on how strong a curry flavor you prefer"
- "1 Tablespoon fish sauce"
- "1 Tablespoon lime juice"
- "1 teaspoon kosher salt"
- "1 teaspoon sugar"
- "1 can coconut milk theyre usually somewhere between 13 and 15 ounces"
recipeinstructions:
- "In a preheated medium high pan, saute the aromatics - onion, garlic, ginger, chilies, chili flakes, and lime zest - in the 2 Tablespoons of oil until the onions are translucent. Add the curry powder, stir to incorporate, and let the curry bloom for a minute or so."
- "Add the remainder of the ingredients and stir to incorporate thoroughly, turn the heat up to high, and bring the curry to an active boil for a minute."
- "Add in your protein and veg and bring the curry back up to a boil for a minute or so, turn the heat down to medium high, and let it simmer, uncovered, for 5 minutes, or until your protein is cooked through. Bite sized pieces of seafood will take no time at all (3 to 5 minutes), white meat chicken a little bit longer (5 to 7 minutes), and dark meat yet longer (7 to 10 minutes)."
- "Give it a stir, adjust the seasoning if needed - a little more salt or fish sauce if you want it saltier, a little more lime juice if you like extra tang, maybe a pinch more of sugar to round out all the flavors - simmer another minute or two, and that&#39;s it! Serve with steamed rice."
- "For the curry in this pic I used: 1 pound shrimp, peeled and deveined (I used 31/40 size), 1/2 pound button or crimini mushrooms, 1/2 pound snow peas, 1/2 red bell pepper cut into 1/4-inch strips, and an 8 oz can (the short one) of bamboo shoots, drained. But you can of course use whatever veg you like and have handy, following the general measurement guidelines of 1 pound of protein and 1 pound of veg for 4 servings."
- "Enjoy! :)"
