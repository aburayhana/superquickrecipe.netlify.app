- "4 grams Sea Salt"
- "2 grams Dry yeast"
- "144 grams Water cold water in the summer"
- "1 3/5 liter Water for kettle boiling"
- "1 1/2 tbsp Molasses"
recipeinstructions:
- "Place the water into the bread machine, followed by the ● ingredients and start the kneading process for 7 minutes.  If there is a separate compartment for kneading ingredients into the dough, adjust the water and add it in here."
- "When the dough has finished, remove it and hand knead for about 3 minutes. If adding fillings, put them in now. Measure them, divide them, and form them into ellipses. Let it rest for 10 minutes."
- "Roll the dough into a cylinder and flatten one end. Bring the other end around and tightly bind the edges together."
- "Place the dough on a baking tray lined with parchment paper and dusted with corn meal. Cover with a plastic bag and let rise for 30 minutes."
- "Boil the water for the kettling and dissolve the molasses so that it is ready for the end of the rising. Preheat the oven to 200°C."

- "I recommend freezing the ones you won&#39;t eat within a few days. You can eat them as-is after they thaw out, or you can toast or microwave them. Warm them up for 10 seconds in the microwave at a high temperature and they will be nice and plum."
- "These are plain bagels. Just using bread flour. They&#39;re good for bagel sandwiches or with your favorite jam."
- "Here are cinnamon raisin bagels. Add 72g of raisins and some cinnamon. These are excellent with cream cheese!"

- "&#34;My Bagel Sandwich&#34; Delicious."
- "&#34;Rusk Bagels&#34; I might make bagels just for this."
