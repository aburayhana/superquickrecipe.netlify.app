recipeinstructions:
- "With a knife, poke small holes all around the sausage so it absorbs the seasoning better and to help it properly cook through. Season the beef sausage, first with lemon juice and vegetable oil, then the salt, followed by the paprika and onion and garlic powder. Cover with cling film or a towel and leave on the counter for 10 minutes or in the fridge overnight."

After, cook the beef sausage your favourite way to do so, I grilled mine. To finish prep, microwave the hot dog bun for about 15 - 20 seconds. Split the bun in the middle but not all the way through and spread the butter evenly over the inside of the bun."
- "To assemble, place the lettuce in the middle of the bun followed by the beef sausage and next just fill up any spaces with fries and cucumber cut into sticks. To finish, drizzle over some tomato ketchup and salad cream or mayonnaise. Enjoy!"
