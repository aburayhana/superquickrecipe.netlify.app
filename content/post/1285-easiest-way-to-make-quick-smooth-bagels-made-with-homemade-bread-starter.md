recipeingredient:
- "200 grams Bread strong flour"
- "50 grams Cake flour"
- "100 grams Homemade bread starter"
- "1 tbsp Honey"
- "100 ml Water"
- "1/2 tsp Salt"
recipeinstructions:
- "Mix all the ingredients together."
- "When the dough is no longer floury, take it out onto a work surface and knead it well, putting your weight into it (about 15 minutes). Bagel dough is stiff, so keep kneading patiently."
- "Divide into 4 or 5 portions, round off each portion into a ball and leave to rest for 30 to 40 minutes (depending on the season)."
- "When the dough has rested, roll out each portion in the order they were formed into balls, and deflate them."
- "Roll each piece of dough very tightly into long sausage shapes, so that no air pockets are included. If the dough is on the dry side, wet your fingers and pinch the seams closed very well."
- "Roll each sausage of dough out so that it becomes long and thin. Make one end skinnier and flatten the other end. Put the skinny end on top of the flattened end to form a ring."
- "Here&#39;s how the ring looks."
- "Line up the links on pieces of parchment paper, and leave to rise for 60 minutes. (It&#39;s best to put then on individual pieces of paper so that they are easier to boil later.) Start boiling the water and preheat the oven to 250°C 5 minutes before the dough has finished rising! Put honey in the boiling water. If you have a gas oven, preheat to 210°C."
- "Start boiling the bagels! Boil them in the order they were formed, paper and all, 30 seconds per side. If the water is boiling so fast that it&#39;s bubbling, the dough will get damaged."
- "When all the bagels are boiled, put them in the oven as quickly as possible. If you leave them after they have been boiled they will get wrinkled. Bake for 15 to 20 minutes at 200°C. Please adjust the time depending on your oven and the weather."
- "Done! Be careful not to let them burn!"
