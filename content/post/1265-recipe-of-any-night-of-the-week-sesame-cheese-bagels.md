recipeinstructions:
- "Mix all of the ingredients together aside from the sugar that is to be used for boiling the bagels. Increase the amount of lukewarm water as needed while keeping an eye on it. It&#39;s okay if it seems like the amount of water isn&#39;t quite enough."
- "The dough is a bit hard, so knead it strongly. Make sure not to overknead the dough. The dough contains sesame, so it is okay if the surface is a bit rough."
- "Immediately divide into 7 equal portions. Roll them up, and cover with a wet cloth to keep the dough from drying out. Rest the dough for 10 minutes."
- "Shape the dough. Please refer to the cone bagel recipe. Roll it up while enclosing the cheese.  https://cookpad.com/us/recipes/148554-corn-bagels"
- "After shaping, proof for the final time for 20-30 minutes. Be careful not to let the dough dry out. The dough is ready once it reaches 1.5 times its original size."
- "Add sugar to a large pot, bring to a boil, and boil the bagels for a minute (30 seconds per side). Top with easy-melting cheese after boiling if you like, and bake."
- "Bake in the oven at 190℃ for 15-18 minutes. Please make adjustments according to your household oven. You can add in the cheese or not, according to your tastes."
- "I also made whole wheat flour bagels."
