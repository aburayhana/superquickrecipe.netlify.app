recipeinstructions:
- "Put the bread flour, sugar, salt, and dry yeast into the bowl. (Make a dent in the middle of the flour to add the sugar and dry yeast.)"
- "Microwave the soy milk for 30 seconds until it is warm to the touch. Add into the center of the bowl, and mix with the dry yeast first before mixing everything together. Knead for 10 minutes until the dough becomes shiny."

- "Boil water in a pan large enough to boil all the bagels in one go. Mix in the honey to dissolve and boil the bagels, 30 seconds on each side (use a spatula and move the bagels around so that they won&#39;t touch each other or the bottom of the pan.)"
- "Drain and put them into the oven immediately. Bake for 15 to 18 minutes at 200℃ to finish."
