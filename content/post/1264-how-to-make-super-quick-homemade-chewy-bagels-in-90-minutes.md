recipeingredient:
- "300 grams Bread flour"
- "1 tbsp Sugar"
- "3 grams Salt"
- "3/4 tsp Dry yeast"
- "160 grams Lukewarm water warm to the touch"
- "1 tbsp for 1 liter of water Honey for boiling"
- "1 Flour for dusting"
recipeinstructions:
- "Add yeast to the lukewarm water, mix and dissolve to activate."
- "Combine the bread flour, sugar, salt and the yeast from Step 1 in a large bowl."
- "Mix all the ingredients in the bowl by hand. When the dough comes together and is no longer floury, move to a working surface."
- "Using palms of both hands, knead the dough by pressing it away from you over and over again for 3-5 minutes (you&#39;ll see the dough gradually moistening and holding together)."
- "(Note) You could also use a bread machine until this step! Set the machine before you leave the house and when you come back it is done."
- "Using a knife, divide the dough into 6 portions. Roll each dough into a smooth ball. (Let it rest for 10 minutes) Cover the dough with slightly damp cloth."
- "Using a rolling pin, flatten the dough to about 20 cm in length. Tuck in both ends."
- "Shape the dough into rings by covering one end over the other. Close the seam tightly.  (These are pre-risen sesame bagels in the photo)."
- "Place the dough onto a cookie sheet, cover it with damp cloth, and allow it to rise at 25℃ room temperature [Proof for 45 minutes] When the room is cold, I put the tray on top of a skillet with hot water."
- "Ref) They will look like these after 40-45 minutes of rising (these are sesame bagels). The dough has doubled in size."
- "10 minutes before rising finishes, start preheating the oven to 190℃ (if you are using a portable oven, place the baking sheet on top to help the dough to rise)."
- "5 minutes before rising finishes, bring some water to a boil in a large skillet and melt the honey (use the skillet that was used in Step 9, so you will have one less thing to clean)."
- "Adjust step 12 so the water is boiling gently, slide in the dough top side down first for a minute, flip the dough and boil the other side for another minute."
- "Scoop up the bagel and immediately place it onto the cooking sheet.  Bake for 20 minutes in a 190℃ oven and it is done!"
- "I split the bagel in half by hand! It has a wonderfully nice and smooth texture! Toast and enjoy its crunchiness!"
- "Black sesame bagels. The aroma of the sesame is exquisite!"
- "ma-natto bagels. Make the dough long and thin then spread and roll up the ama-natto into the dough. The soft texture of the  ama-natto is perfect with the bagels!"
