- "200 grams Bread or cake flour"
- "1/2 tbsp Sugar"
- "1 pinch Salt"
- "2/3 tsp Dry yeast"
- "120 ml Lukewarm water"
- "1 tbsp Honey or sugar"
recipeinstructions:
- "Blend the flour and salt. Mix the water with the sugar and yeast, and allow it to  soak. Sprinkle the flour evenly over the water and cut in with a spatula."
- "Once the mixture begins to stick, use your hands to bring it to one mass. After all the flour has been incorporated, knead for 5~10 minutes by folding over the dough. Continue until there are no lumps."
- "Place a plastic wrapper over the dough and let it rest at room temperature for at least 10 minutes. If you&#39;re letting it rise at low temperature, leave step 4 in the fridge over night. In the morning, warm up the dough by kneading a bit and then proceed to step 5."
- "Divide into small portions, knead and form small balls. Cover them with a damp towel and leave them at room temperature for at least 10 minutes."
- "Preheat the oven to 200℃. Stick your finger in the center and make a hole. Make sure the hole is in the middle from bird&#39;s eye view so that the dough expands evenly."
- "Kettling: Fill the frying pan with 3 cm of water, and boil to around 85℃. Add honey to bring out the glaze. Place parchment paper in the pan and boil each side of the bagel for 30~60 seconds."
- "Pat dry the bagels and bake them right away in the oven at 200℃ for 15 minutes, or until ready."
- "This is a cross-section. Fluffy and chewy, just as if they are store-bought Freshly made and still warm."
- "If you&#39;re filling the bagel, flatten the shape in an oval in step 5."
- "I made it into a egg salad sandwich."
