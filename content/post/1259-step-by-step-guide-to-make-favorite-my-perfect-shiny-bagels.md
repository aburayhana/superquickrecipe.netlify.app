recipeingredient:
- "150 grams Bread strong flour"
- "1 tbsp Sugar"
- "1/2 tsp Salt"
- "1 tsp Dry yeast"
- "80 ml Lukewarm water to dissolve the dry yeast"
- "1 tsp Olive oil"
- "2 tbsp Dried fruits or sesame seeds optional"
- "2 tbsp Honey or sugar if you dont have honey"
recipeinstructions:
- "◎Kneading◎ Put all the ingredients except the honey and dried fruit into a food processor and process for 2 to 3 minutes. (If you use your hands mix and knead the dough for approximately 10 minutes to bring the dough together until elastic."
- "Add the dried fruit at this point if you use any and knead until the dried fruit are distributed evenly.  If the dried fruit of your choice is chunky chop them first. Otherwise it will be difficult to shape the dough later with chunky fruit. If you add the dried fruit before mixing the other ingredients in the food processor they will be shredded inside and the resultant dough doesn&#39;t look as good."
- "The first proving: Shape the dough into a big ball and put into a plastic bag. Keep it in a 40℃ oven for 12 minutes or in a warm place for 20 minutes. The dough doesn&#39;t have to rise so much. I divided the dough into 2 portions with dried tomatoes and chocolate chips."
- "◎Resting◎Divide the dough into 4 portions and shape into small balls. Place the dough balls with the seam side down and cover with moistened tea towel. Leave to rest for 10 minutes."
- "◎Shaping◎Place the dough ball with the seam side up. Roll out into a flat round and roll up into a sausage shape. It is very elastic so it is difficult to shape. Try to stretch the dough from the centre towards the edges with your hands."
- "Flatten one end of the sausage shape and join to the other end to make a ring shape. Splash the ends with a tiny bit of water and squeeze them together to seal."
- "◎The second proving◎ Place the prepared dough onto baking parchment and leave in the 40℃ oven for 15 minutes. Spray the surface with some water (or splash water with your fingers). They don&#39;t have to rise so much at this point either."
- "Remove the bagels from the oven and preheat the oven to 210℃-250℃. (The bagels will actually be baked at 200℃ but when you open the oven door the temperature drops. Set the temperature higher for this reason)."
- "When the oven is at about 150℃ heat a frying pan of water to simmer until about 80℃. Add the honey. At 80℃ the water is bubbling gently. Honey works better than sugar to create a shiny finish."
- "◎Kettling◎ Place the bagel dough into the simmering water and cook each side for 30 seconds. Cooking for too long causes wrinkles on the surface. Cook until the bagels have risen a little."
- "◎Baking◎Line a baking tray with the parchment paper you used in the previous step. Place the kettled bagel dough on the oven tray and put the tray into the oven straight away (It is alright if the bagel surface is wet.) The oven is already preheated so bake at 200℃ for 10-15 minutes. While baking the bagels will rise a lot and become shiny and plump."
- "Tip: Brush the surface with a tiny bit of butter and spread with kitchen paper to create shiner finish. How shiny!"
