recipeingredient:
- "200 grams Bread strong flour"
- "50 grams Whole wheat flour or regular flour"
- "1 tsp Dry yeast"
- "15 grams Honey or raw sugar regular sugar"
- "1/2 tsp Salt"
- "140 ml Water 30C lukewarm water in winter"
- " Kettling"
- "1 liter Water in pot plus 2 tbsp honey or sugar for kettling"
recipeinstructions:
- "In a bowl, combine the bread flour and the whole wheat flour. Make a well in the center and add honey and yeast into it. Place salt away from the yeast, then pour the water aiming at the yeast."
- "Start mixing the yeast and honey with the water, gradually start kneading by incorporating the flour into the dough. It should take about 15 minutes.  (If using a bread machine, set it to the dough cycle.  Follow the Steps 3 through 7, skip Step 8 and move to Step 9.)"
- "Once the dough becomes smooth and does not tear when you stretch it, divide it into quarters then place on to a pan, seam side down.  (Close the seam by pinching it tightly with fingers).  Cover the dough with a firmly squeezed damp cloth.  Let it rest for 15 minutes."
- "Once the dough starts to bulge up and the surface looks smooth, flip the dough over seam side up, then roll it out into an oval shape while removing trapped gas."
- "Roll the dough into a cylinder shape by rolling it up from the edge closer to you. Roll it very tightly."
- "Flatten one of the ends."
- "Form the dough into a ring; wrap the other end with the flattened end, pinch the dough to secure it at the back."
- "In an oven with a rising function, allow the dough to rise at 30°C for 30 minutes. (If your oven doesn&#39;t have the rising function, add 30℃ lukewarm water in a large tray, place a smaller tray inside of it, then set the dough in it with room for it to expand. Cover the dough with damp cloth and let it rise for 30 minutes.)"
- "Bring water to a boil in a large pot, add the honey and insert the risen dough. Boil each side of the dough for 30 seconds. Don&#39;t boil too long or it&#39;ll get wrinkly!! (While the water is boiling, preheat the oven to 190°C)."
- "Place the boiled dough onto a dry cloth to wipe the excess water, place it onto a parchment paper lined cookie sheet, then bake for 15 minutes in a 190°C oven."
- "Sandwich bacon, egg, lettuce, and tomato for breakfast!"
- "These bagels in the photo are made using a secret technique!! No rising time necessary! Just mix the dough and you can make surprisingly chewy bagels!"
