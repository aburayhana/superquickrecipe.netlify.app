recipeinstructions:
- "Put all the ingredients for the dough into a bowl.  Knead for 10 minutes, working it hard.  The dough should be as soft as an earlobe.  It is hard work, but keep it up!!"

- "Using a rolling pin, roll out the dough into 15cm rounds, making sure that the thickness is even."
- "Start rolling the dough up.  Be careful not to make it too loose or air will get in."

- "Tightly close the seams.  If they are loose, the rings will break while boiling. Let rise for 20 minutes."
- "While the dough is rising, get ready for kettling.  In a large skillet, bring water to a boil and add the honey (or sugar).  This process adds a shine to the bagel when you bake it."
- "Before the rising time is over, preheat the oven to 200℃  Start boiling the bagels once the oven is hot."
- "Boil the bagels for 30 seconds on each side.  Scoop up and dry the excess water with a paper towel and put them in the oven immediately.  Bake for 20 minutes at  200℃"
- "They&#39;re done. Fresh from the oven bagels are really yummy!  The cooled bagels can be brought back to the freshly baked taste by toasting in a toaster oven."
- "They have a lot of blueberries and  are so yummy."
