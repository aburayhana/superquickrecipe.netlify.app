Add chicken, chicken bouillon, onion, and garlic. The way gorditas are made in Mexico actually varies from region to region. My family is from the central/north part of the country in the state of Zacatecas near the town of Sombrerete. This is how they&#39;re usually made there, but in other regions of the country, they&#39;re often fried until super crispy and then stuffed. Gorditas are thicker than corn tortillas so of course it&#39;s going to take longer to get the center cooked.
